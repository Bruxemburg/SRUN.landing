        The elders of the SRUN were living peacefully, until they met with the problem on the bus. They were sleeping over their bus stops. Again and again... Every single morning... They once noticed that not only they were afflicted by thy problem, but the weaker creatures too. They called themselves 'people'.

        So the Andrei the Reasonable and Pavel the Knowledgeable along with the most intelligent people whom were called Daniel the Righteous and George the Courageous decided. They shall bring an end to this disease.

        Making of the cure wasn't easy indeed. They were hit with many problems. Such as decision of the 'library' and language for thy 'app'. But it was decided that with Vue and capacitor will be armed our heroes in the making of the cure.

        The 'app' shall be accessed on any 'OS' thy elders said. It shall contain an 'alarm clock' with the 'gps' so that when the diseased gets closer to the bus stop it alarms thy. It shall also contain 'tips and tricks category' for thy sick souls seek providence in those.
